## Overview

An app that provides users with 24/7 data regarding air pollution and solutions to improve air quality. Informs those who are concerned about the environment.

## What is AI.R?

**AIR**

Emphasizes the use of AI technology to provide various solutions and information on the topic of air quality and cleaner air.

## Why AI.R?

Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health and environmental sustainability, especially in urban areas like San Jose. Vehicle emissions, which are produced when fossil fuels are burned, contribute to this problem. As air pollution levels rise, respiratory problems and other health issues become more prevalent among the population.
We offer:
- Real-time data on local air quality levels in cities across the Bay Area
- Compares different city air quality data
- Generates solutions across different categories (industrial, transportation, urban planning) to improve air quality based on user inputs.
- Promotes workaround transportation options by optimizing and mapping efficient public transit routes.

## The Solution

We developed an app on Streamlit that leverages AI to combat air pollution and promote sustainability in our local community. It has three main functions: 
1) An air quality monitoring service that displays real-time AQI and pollution levels for various cities, allowing users to compare data across multiple locations.
2) A NLP generator that provides recommendations on three solutions (Industrial/Energy solutions, Public Transportation Solutions, and Urban Planning / Green Spaces) based on the user's city/state.
3) A public transit routing system that uses real-life data from Google Maps to display the best routes for users to take to reduce their carbon footprint while traveling within their city.

Through AI utilization and the use of real-time data, it aims to make users more aware of their environmental impact and make more sustainable choices in their daily lives. By providing personalized recommendations and empowering users with information, it introduces a more eco-friendly and hands-on approach to reducing carbon emissions.
